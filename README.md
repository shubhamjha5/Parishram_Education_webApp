PROBLEM STATEMENT :-

A group of college students who are studying remotely due to the pandemic are facing difficulties in managing their course materials and assignments. They are struggling to keep up with the deadlines and are finding it hard to stay motivated. They are also feeling disconnected from their classmates and professors. The current learning management system (LMS) provided by the college is only accessible through a desktop or laptop, which is not always convenient for the students.

To address these challenges, the college has decided to organize a hackathon to develop a mobile app for their LMS that will cater to the needs of the students. The app should be user-friendly, engaging, and accessible from anywhere, at any time. It should allow students to easily access their course materials, submit assignments, receive notifications, and interact with their peers and professors. The app should also track their progress, provide personalized feedback, and motivate them to stay on track.

The goal of the hackathon is to develop a mobile app that will enhance the learning experience of remote students, and help them overcome the challenges they face in managing their studies. The winning team will have their app integrated into the college's existing LMS, and receive recognition for their efforts.
